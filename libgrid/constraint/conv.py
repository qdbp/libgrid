    Represents a local grid constraint that can be expressed as a convolution:

        G âŠ› T >= k * T[jx..., jdx]

    Where:
        G is the binary occupancy map
        T is some template with:
            T.ndim == G.ndim
            T.shape[-1] == G.shape[-1]
            T.shape[:-1] < G.shape[:-1]
        jx is the relative position, in the template, of the keynode
        jdx is the occupant-identity of the keynode, defined by the grid

    In human terms, this is to test for the presence of an occupant type X,
    and for every such occupant make sure that its surroundings, defined by T
    match what is found in G to tolerance k.

    For example, suppose we are laying out a 2D garden and declare that every
    pinwheel should be surrounded on adjacent sides by gnomes. Suppose the
    occupant index of a pinwheel is 5, and that of gnomes is 7. Suppose there
    are 10 total possible garden blocks.

    Then our template would have shape (3, 3, 10), and would be zero everywhere
    except for:
        T[0, 1, 7] = T[1, 0, 7] = T[1, 2, 7] = T[2, 1, 7]

    which defines the pattern of gnomes we are looking for. Since we want
    all the gnomes, we have k = 4, jx = (1, 1) and jdx = 5.
    This would result in the following inequality being defined at each valid
    spot (i, j) in the garden.

    G[i,j+1,7] + G[i+1,j,7] + G[i+1,j+2,7] + G[i+2,j+1,7] >= 4 * G[i+1,j+1,5]

    Which can be read as simply: if there is a pinwheel, we want the sum of
    (this tile is a gnome) on the adjacent sides to equal 4.

        The grid is expanded in each dimension by the shape of the template

        However, only overlaps where the template's key overlaps the true
        grid are considered.

        By default, the expanded grid is zero padded: this assumes a strict
        requirement condition. This can be relaxed by adding elements to
        `boundary_tiles` -- the value of the tile plane for each of these
        will be set to 1 in the border. They will not be mutually exclusive.

        For the pinwheel example: by default, it could not go on the edge of the
        garden, because "off the edge" is assumed to have no tile. We could
        pass "gnome" as a boundary tile, in which case we could place pinwheels!
